Pull request on Github

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened,
you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

CSS preprocessor
A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax. There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from, however most CSS preprocessors will add some features that don't exist in pure CSS,
such as mixin, nesting selector, inheritance selector, and so on. These features make the CSS structure more readable and easier to maintain.
To use a CSS preprocessor, you must install a CSS compiler on your web server; Or use the CSS preprocessor to compile on the development environment,
and then upload compiled CSS file to the web server.
